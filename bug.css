The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue is that if the `div` elements do not have enough horizontal space to fit side-by-side, they might overlap or wrap in unexpected ways depending on the browser's rendering engine.
